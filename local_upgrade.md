linter-coffeelint will prefer to use the version of CoffeeLint you have installed in your project (`npm install --save-dev coffeelint`).

If you've been directed here it means your local coffeelint is in some way incompatible with linter-coffeelint. You need to upgrade with `npm install --save-dev coffeelint@latest`
